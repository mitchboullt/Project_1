# Most Valuable Players

In the NBA every season, one question that is always being asked is "Who is going to win the MVP aaward?"
This question had led us to wonder, how do players win MVP? 
In this project we have used nba_api on github and some statistics from ESPN to help us test the three following hypothesis:

## Is there one institution (either college or franchise ) developing/idenitifing talent better that better than the rest?

For this, we used the nba_api to look through all the drafts statistics to figure out if there is a correlation between the numbers of MVPs and the college they attended.
We also used the data to cross reference the number of MVPs each team has produced.

## Playing certain positions increases the probability to win MVP award.

* A Finals MVP datasheet was used to highlight any relationships between total postions and the number of MVPs since 1960. We have observed if there was any trend over the decades.

## Is it physical attributes or skillset that favor the MVPs contenders?

For that, we used the nba_api to source the complete draft combined physical player statistics. We then compared the MVPs physical attributes with the league average. 
We also plotted the total MVP height over the decade to see if there was any trend. 
Finally, we used an ESPN dataset to analyze the different rubrics that media and sports analysts use to rank their top five players.
