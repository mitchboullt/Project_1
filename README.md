# Project-1

We as a group decided to look into the data related to basket ball and eventually findout if there were any determining factors behind a player becoming the most valuable one day! To us this was a fascinating project as we thought we might just stumble upon a trend that leads to certain attributes which are essential in an MVP or the "Most Valuable Player"! In order to narrow down this project we developed the following research questions:

1.	Which college has produced the highest number of MVPS.
2.	Which team produced the most MVP players.
3.  The most valuable player and their position.
4.	Find average height of the MVP players.

We as a team have tried our best to find answers to these questions and hence uncover if there is any other attribute other than their skill sets that is making these players stand out.
